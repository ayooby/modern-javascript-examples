## Intro
I've made this Repo to showoff my JS skill, and on the top of that maybe it can be used as a refrence for other people.

## Running tests
run
```
npm install
npm start
```
You can then view the tests in your browser at

[http://localhost:4444/](http://localhost:4444/)

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to

get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the

files in the `tests/` directory, and edit the files in the `src/` directory.

Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to seewhether it worked.
## Sections
You can first try to learn each section by reading the test. so you can learn how to code better.
